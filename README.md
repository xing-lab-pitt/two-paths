# two-paths

## Overview
This repository contains the data and jupyter notebooks used to produce the findings in the two-paths paper. Three datasets were used a static MCF10A dataset from Panchey et al., a time course MCF10A dataset from Deshmukh et al., and a time course A549 dataset from Cook et al. All these datasets were cells treated with TGFb to induce EMT.
