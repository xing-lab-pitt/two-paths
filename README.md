# two-paths

## Overview
This repository contains the data and jupyter notebooks used to produce the findings in the two-paths paper. The scRNA-seq MCF10A dataset of cells treated with increasing doses of TGF-b, to induce EMT, from Panchey et al., was analyzed. In addition, we also analyzed 4i data of MCF10A cells treated with TGF-b for 0, 3, and 14 days.
